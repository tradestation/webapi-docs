The TradeStation WebAPI currently supports JSON and XML request/response body formats for all non-streaming methods. The streaming services use JSON exclusively. JSON is the preferred format because it is lighter weight and generally faster to parse.

The format is determined by the `Accept` header of the request.

If no format is specified, the defaulted format is `application/json`.

### Example

    GET https://api.tradestation.com/WebAPI/users/testuser/accounts HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: QUNCSmI
    Accept: application/json
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    Host: api.tradestation.com
    
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Cache-Control: private
    Content-Length: 218
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
    Server: Microsoft-IIS/7.5
    X-AspNet-Version: 4.0.30319
