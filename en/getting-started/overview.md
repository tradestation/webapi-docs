Some fix here: The WebAPI is a collection of RESTful web services for interacting with TradeStation. These services accept and/or return object data via standard HTTP requests.

The WebAPI exposes streaming barchart resources, however, this data is throttled.

All requests are made via HTTPS URIs that represent objects as a hierarchy of resources and/or actions. The data object format is either JSON or XML and is determined by the request's accept header. [Security](../security-overview) is based on the OAuth 2.0 spec and all requests require a user access token be included.

We are currently on Version 2 of the WebAPI - baseurl = [https://api.tradestation.com/v2](https://api.tradestation.com/v2)

Here is a simple example of requesting a list of accounts for a particular user:

### HTTP Request

    GET https://api.tradestation.com/v2/users/testuser/accounts HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: token
    Accept: application/json
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    Host: api.tradestation.com

### HTTP Response

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Cache-Control: private
    Content-Length: 218
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
    Server: Microsoft-IIS/7.5

    }]
