This is the source code repository for the TradeStation WebAPI Documentation.

## Introduction

We believe that the community needs quality documentation to foster innovation. You can inspect the source code for this documentation and make improvements to it. If you want to contribute, please do so! Fork it, hack on it, and send back your changes!

## Structure

The source is structured into the following directories:

`en/` The English version of the documentation

`Note:` Translations are subject to change and may be updated at any time.

## Contributions

We encourage you to fork our work and make your own improvements. If you have any changes you want to send back our way, please make a regular pull request via GitHub. If we like your changes, we may integrate them into the repository and give you credit. If you just have an issue to report, please use the regular GitHub issue system.

## Translations

We'd like to encourage people to start translating the documentation into other languages. If you'd like to start a new translation, please first check to see if one exists in that language. If not, you can get started right away.

Please observe the following guidelines:
* Do start your translation from the `en/` directory
* Do use the appropriate [language tag](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag) for your new directory
* Do not translate from anything other than the `en/` directory, as this will introduce errors
* Do not modify the general markup or structure of the documents
* Do not include your own styles or scripts

Here's an example of how to start a new translation:

    cp -r en jp
    git add jp
    git commit -m 'new Japanese translation' jp
